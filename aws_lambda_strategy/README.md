# AWS Lambda Access Strategy
This example illustrates how to implement a Sym Flow that invokes an AWS Lambda to manage access to resources that Sym does not directly integrate with (such as an internal tool).

## About Sym

This workflow is just one example of how Sym Implementers use the [Sym SDK](https://docs.symops.com/docs) to create [Sym Flows](https://docs.symops.com/docs/sym-access-flows).
