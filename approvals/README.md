# Sym Approvals Quickstart

This is a starter template similar to the Terraform generated by `symflow init`, but with some variable refactoring that an implementer might consider
before deploying their configuration to Production.

Several variables have been pulled out into a `teraform.tfvars` file. Notably:
- `environment_name` and `error_channel_name`.

In this example, `main` has been pulled out into a variable `environment_name`. This allows this `main.tf` to be applied
with a different `terraform.tfvars`, which will then create a different set of resources (e.g. `sandbox` vs `main`)!

This is helpful if you wish to test your configuration with resources in a test environment before configuring Sym with Production data.

Furthermore, `impl.py` has been modified with an `on_approve` and `on_deny` hook that only allows a subset of users defined in `terraform.tfvars > flow_variables["appprovers"]`
to be able to approve and deny requests. 

## About Sym

This workflow is just one example of how Sym Implementers use the [Sym SDK](https://docs.symops.com/docs) to create [Sym Flows](https://docs.symops.com/docs/sym-access-flows).
