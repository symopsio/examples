# OneLogin Access Strategy

This example illustrates how to configure a Sym Flow that uses the OneLogin Access Strategy to escalate a user to a role
in OneLogin. In particular, Sym's OneLogin Access Strategy allows users to become either members or admins of a role,
and this example makes use of [Dynamic Targets](https://docs.symops.com/docs/dynamic-target-settings) to allow users
to select which they want when making their request.
